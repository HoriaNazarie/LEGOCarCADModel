<h1>Lego Car 3D CAD Model</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
I purchased a LEGO car and meticulously measured each piece to capture its exact dimensions and details. Using Solid Edge CAD software, I recreated each component individually with precision, ensuring they matched the original design. Once all the pieces were modeled, I assembled them into a complete 3D virtual model. Additionally, I created detailed 2D drafts of each piece, which are typically used by manufacturers as technical blueprints for production. To showcase the final assembly, I also generated an exploded view, providing a clear and comprehensive visualization of how the components fit together.
